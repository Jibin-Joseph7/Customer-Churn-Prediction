 **Customer Churn Prediction**

This project is focused on predicting customer churn using a ML model built with XGBoost Classifier. The input is customer data and output is whether the customer is likely to churn(leave) or not churn(stay) .

**Technologies Used**

1. Python
2. Pandas,Numpy
3. XGBoost, Scikit-learn
4. Jupyter Notebook
5. Matplotlib/Seaborn
6. Power BI
7. Git for version control

**Dataset**
Format: CSV
Features: include customer attributes like tenure, monthly charges, contract type.
Target: Churn (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

**Project Workflow**

1. Importing Libraries
2. Load & Preprocess Data
3. Train/Test Split
4. Model Training
5. Prediction


Churn Probability: 0.438
Churn Prediction: No
